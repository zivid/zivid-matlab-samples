## Samples list

There are two main categories of samples: **Camera** and
**Applications**. The samples in the **Camera** category focus only on
how to use the camera. The samples in the **Applications** category use
the output generated by the camera, such as the 3D point cloud, a 2D
image or other data from the camera. These samples shows how the data
from the camera can be used.

  - **Camera**
      - **Basic**
          - [Capture](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/Capture.m) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the Zivid camera.
          - [Capture2D](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/Capture2D.m) - Capture 2D images from the Zivid camera.
          - [CaptureAssistant](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/CaptureAssistant.m) - Capture Assistant to capture point clouds, with color,
            from the Zivid camera.
          - [CaptureFromFileCamera](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/CaptureFromFileCamera.m) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the Zivid file
            camera. Currently supported by Zivid One.
          - [CaptureHDR](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/CaptureHDR.m) - Capture HDR point clouds, with color, from the Zivid
            camera.
          - [zividApplication](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/Basic/zividApplication.m) - application = zividApplication(folder)
      - **InfoUtilOther**
          - [GetCameraIntrinsics](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Camera/InfoUtilOther/GetCameraIntrinsics.m) - Read intrinsic parameters from the Zivid camera (OpenCV
            model).
  - **Applications**
      - **Basic**
          - **Visualization**
              - [CaptureFromFileCameraVis3D](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Basic/Visualization/CaptureFromFileCameraVis3D.m) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the virtual
                Zivid camera, and visualize it. Currently supported by
                Zivid One.
              - [CaptureVis3D](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Basic/Visualization/CaptureVis3D.m) - Capture point clouds, with color, from the Zivid
                camera, and visualize it.
          - **FileFormats**
              - [convertZDF](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Basic/FileFormats/convertZDF.m) - convertZDF(inputFileName,outputFileFormat)
              - [ReadIterateZDF](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Basic/FileFormats/ReadIterateZDF.m) - Read point cloud data from a ZDF file, iterate through
                it, and extract individual points.
              - [readZDF](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Basic/FileFormats/readZDF.m) - \[xyz,rgba,snr\] = readZDF(dataFile) - **Advanced**
          - [Downsample](https://github.com/zivid/zivid-matlab-samples/tree/master//source/Applications/Advanced/Downsample.m) - Downsample point cloud from ZDF file.
